class Worldstate:
    pass #TODO: basically just a big dictionary with info on the world. 
    # Everything from what gamenode the character is on to what stats he has, 
    # how his relations to other characters are (has he talked to them, did they like/dislike him), 
    # what he is possibly known for in the world, 
    # what he looks like, what he has in his inventory, 
    # how the world has changed from it's base state (village X is burned to the ground), 
    # stats of other characters, 
    # what gamenode he is currently on, 
    # etc
    # FUTURE: in the future this would have to be a databank
